In this Task I have created API endpoints using Node.js and Express.js to fetch data from a public API (https://api.publicapis.org/entries). Here's a brief overview:

Set Up Node.js and Express.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You'll also need to initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.js as a dependency using npm.

Create API Routes: Define API routes using Express.js to handle incoming requests. These routes will serve as endpoints for fetching data from the public API.

Fetch Data from Public API: Use JavaScript's built-in fetch function or a library like Axios to make HTTP requests to the provided public API (https://api.publicapis.org/entries). Retrieve data from the API in JSON format.

Implement Filtering Options: Implement filtering options in your API endpoints to allow users to specify categories and result limits for data retrieval.

In this code:

We require express and node-fetch modules.

We define two endpoints:
/users: Fetches users from the public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
/users/:userId/posts: Fetches posts for a specific user using the user ID parameter.
Inside each endpoint handler, we use fetch to make requests to the public API and retrieve data.
We handle errors by catching exceptions and sending appropriate error responses.
Finally, we start the server and listen on the specified port.

You can test these endpoints by running this Node.js script. Accessing http://localhost:3000/users and http://localhost:3000/users/{userId}/posts will return the corresponding data from the public API.
